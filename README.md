## Issue reporting guidelines
To maintain an effective issues and bug fix workflow, please, follow some simple guidelines.
<br>
Before creating an issue, please do the following:
</br><br>
Check the Developer Documentation to make sure the behavior you are reporting is really a bug, not a feature.
Check the existing issues to make sure you are not duplicating somebody’s work.
If you are sure that the problem you are experiencing is caused by a bug, file a new issue in a Github issue tracker following the recommendations below.
</br>
### [Issue Template](documents/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)<br>
Issue Reporting Template is a default placeholder for every new issue. 

Higher level of detail in the report increases chance that someone will be able to reproduce the issue. 

### Title
Title is a vital part of bug report for developer and triager to quickly identify a unique issue. A well written title should contain a clear explanation of the issue to allow quick identify the problem.

Good example would be:

*Unable to delete single project.*

*Can't remove.*

### Issue Description
